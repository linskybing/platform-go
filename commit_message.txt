feat: Modernize platform architecture to multi-tenant cloud-native standard

This commit completes the architectural refactoring of the platform, transitioning from legacy patterns to a high-concurrency, high-integrity system leveraging advanced PostgreSQL and Kubernetes best practices.

Core Architectural Changes:
- **Global UUID Standard**: Standardized all primary and foreign keys to UUID v4 across the entire system (User, Group, Project, Job, ConfigCommit, Image, etc.).
- **Class Table Inheritance (CTI)**: Implemented `resource_owners` supertype to enforce strict referential integrity for polymorphic associations (Storage, Audit Logs).
- **Hierarchical Project Management**: Refactored `projects` to use PostgreSQL `ltree` extension for optimized subtree queries and tree traversal.
- **High-Concurrency Job Queue**: Optimized job fetching using `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` to eliminate worker contention.
- **Git-like Configuration Versioning**: Implemented Content-Addressable Storage (CAS) for deduplicated, immutable configuration blobs.
- **Advanced Scheduling**: Implemented `int4range` time windows with `EXCLUDE USING GIST` constraints to prevent resource over-allocation at the database level.

API & Frontend Enhancements:
- **Response Standardization**: All endpoints now return a unified `StandardResponse` wrapper.
- **RESTful Compliance**: Standardized status codes (e.g., 201 Created for POST) and query binding.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Established full English documentation including architecture guides, database schema details, and a dedicated frontend integration guide.

Cleanup & Verification:
- **Legacy Removal**: Deleted over 20 redundant test files and removed outdated ID aliases (UID, GID, PID) from domain models and repositories.
- **Full Test Coverage**: Updated and verified the entire integration test suite to align with the new UUID schema and standardized API format.
- **Robust Helpers**: Enhanced integration test helpers with automatic table cleanup and global image whitelisting for stable verification.

Files Modified:
- `internal/domain/`: Full entity refactoring to UUID and clean structs.
- `internal/repository/`: Optimized SQL patterns and tree operations.
- `internal/api/`: Standardized handlers and middleware extractors.
- `docs/en/`: New technical documentation set.
- `test/integration/`: Comprehensive suite updates.
